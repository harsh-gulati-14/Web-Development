	<h3>"If you love life, don't waste time,for time is what life is made up of</h3>
	<h2><center>MY THOUGHTS</center></h2>
	<h3><p>Self doubt destroys more dreams then failure ever can!

I've seen many people willing to do great things, having #plans in mind, having #dreams. But, all they do is #daydream. Not because day dreaming is much easier than actually #working, neither because they are afraid of working #hard. The reason that I found most common between these people was that they are afraid of critics, they think more of things that can go #wrong rather than those which can go #right. 

People think too much on whether people will #like their views or not, or maybe people will start #criticizing. Well I got one thing to tell you, 
If the only thing you want to do is please people, and be liked by everyone, my friend you are going to fail!
No matter what you do, there will be people who will be unhappy, so #stop #worrying about them and #work for yourself, not because it will give you fame, but because it is your #duty.</p></h3>
